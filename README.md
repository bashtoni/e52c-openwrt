# Radxa e52c OpenWrt Image Builder

The code in this repo is inspired by https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit

There are a few major differences:

- Only Radxa e52c supported
- Uses the official OpenWrt rootfs
- Builds without requiring root privileges

For now this still uses a modified kernel from https://github.com/breakingbadboy/OpenWrt
